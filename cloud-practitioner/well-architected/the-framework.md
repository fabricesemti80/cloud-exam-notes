# The ~~5~~ 6 Pillars Overview

The well architected framework is based on five pillars:

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Cost Optimisation
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency

## Game Days

- Setting up and testing your response processes
- Standing up your prod architecture and attacking it for the purposes of breaking it

##  Pillar 1: Operational Excellence

_Does our application work? Will our application continue to work?_

- Operations as code
- Documentation is updated automatically
- Small changes (with rollback plans)
- Tighten feedback loops (iterate)
- Expect failure (red team, game days)
- Learn from failures and successes

##  Pillar 2: Security

_Does it do what we want? (And only that?)_

- Identities have the least priveledges possible
- Who who did what and when?
- Automate security tasks
- Encrypt data at transit and at rest
- Prepare for the worst (woven into game days)

##  Pillar 3: Cost Optimisation

_Spend only what you have to_

- Consumption based pricing
- Measure efficiency constantly
- Let AWS do the work when necessary
- Ties closely to operational performance

##  Pillar 4: Reliability

_Is what you built going to work consistently?_

- Recover from issues automatically
- Scale horizontally (where possible)
- Reduce idle resources (operational burden, attack surface increase)
- Manage change through automation

##  Pillar 5: Performance Efficiency

- Let AWS do the work (when possible)
- Reduce latency through regions & AWS edge
- Serverless > Containers > Instances

##  Pillar 6: Sustainability

- “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”
- understanding the impacts of the services used
- quantifying impacts through the entire workload lifecycle
- and applying design principles and best practices to reduce these impacts
