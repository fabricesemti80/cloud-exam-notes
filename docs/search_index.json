Metrics\n\nStandard metric time for EC2 cloudwatch metrics is 5 minutes\nDetailed monitoring is 1 minute\nHigh resolution monitoring allows faster resolution (can be as low as 1 second)\n\nEC2 CloudWatch metrics out-of-the-box\n\nCPU\nNetwork\nDisk\nStatus Check\n\nNote: RAM is a custom metric\nSetting up a Custom EC2 Metric\n\nInstall the cloudwatch agent on your machine (using user data startup script)\nYou use a user data script to configure your EC2\nUser data scripts must provider their interpreter (Use a shebang (#!/bin/bash)\nScripts are executed as root\nOn Ubuntu you can run this as a crontab (put a shell script into a cron folder)\n\nThe Four EC2 Pricing Models\n\nOn Demand\nReserved\nHas an Upfront price (fixed cost)\n3 year term (check this?)\nUseful for repeating resources (day/week/year)\n\n\nSpot\nVery low prices\n\n\nDedicated\nNo virtualisation with other tenants\nGood for certain licenses (Oracle)\n\n\n\nEBS, The 4 Volume Types\n\nSolid State Drives (They‚Äôre expensive, but much quicker)\nGP2\nIs a general purpose volume (generic use cases)\nUp to 10,000 iops\nPerformance is linked to the size of the volume\nAllows IOPS bursting\n\n\nIO1\nHighest performance volume\nMission critical stuff\nProvisioned IOPS\nUsed for high throughput databases etc\nHard Disk Drives (They‚Äôre cheaper, but performance is massively reduced)\n\n\nST1\nCan‚Äôt be boot, quite slow still\nBig data (non-production, but still performant)\n\n\nSC1\nBasically for very low cost (but slow)\nUsed for large and infrequent access\nHas a lower storage cost\n\n\n\nEBS Volume Pre-Warming\n\nPre-warming is an optimisation to prevent cold access of EBS blocks\nThere is no need to warm EBS any more unless you‚Äôre restoring from S3, where you may want to pre-warm as each accessed block will have a ‚Äúfirst touch penalty‚Äù.\nYou can warm EBS with a bash command that touches all files internally\nUse the dd or fio command and read all files to /dev/null as a pre-warming process.\n\n\n\nEBS Cloudwatch\n\nRead/Writeops (I/O operations per second)\nAmount of IOPS per second\n\n\nQueue length\nYou really don‚Äôt want anything queuing\n\n\n\nThe Four EBS Volume Statuses\n\nOK ‚Äî Volume is running fine\nWarning ‚Äî Degraded performance, pushing to queue?\nImpaired ‚Äî Not working, maybe I/O is disabled?\nInsufficient Data ‚Äî Not enough data!\n\nApplying changes: When you modify block storage, you might need to adjust your OS to see the higher volume size. You can also apply changes whilst the EBS is running.\nELBs\n\nELB have listeners (for connections using defined protocol and ports)\nRegister health checks on the ELB to ensure that service health (before routing)\nYou can load balance across regular instances and serverless\nBy default load balancers distribute across specified AZ‚Äôs\n\nTypes of ELB\n\nApplication Load Balancer\nSupports path based routing\nCan forward requests with modified headers (operates at application level)\n\n\nNetwork Load Balancer\nTransport layer routing (TCP/SSL)\nVery fast, millions of RPS\nForwards requests without modifying headers (it can‚Äôt)\nFor very low latency needs\n\n\nClassic Load Balancer (to be deprecated)\nSupports sticky sessions (using app generated cookies)\n\n\nEphemeral ports?\n\nMonitoring ELB\n\nCloud Watch (for 4/5xx‚Äôs, healthy hosts count)\nAccess Logs (are disabled by default)\nThey dump to S3 so can be hard to analyse (require 3rd party tool)\n\n\nRequest Tracing\nThey‚Äôre good because they can access data after an ELB scales down\nAdds a header to requests before sending on (so they can be correlated)\n\n\n\nCloudwatch Dashboards\n\nDashboards aren‚Äôt regional specific\nCan add lines, stacks, numbers and charts\n\n\nView data usage, memory\nRemember to save your dashboard\n\nCreating a Billing Alarm\n\nYou can setup a threshold when you want to be alerted\nCreate people who are to be alerted\n\nCloudWatch Vs CloudTrail vs Config\n\nCloudwatch\nFor logs and monitoring of applications (performance monitoring)\n\n\nCloudTrail\nAllows you to see what changes have been made to the AWS API\n\n\nConfig\nRecords the state of AWS environments\n\n\n\nElasticache monitoring metrics\n\nCPU utilisation\nSwap usage\nYou don‚Äôt want to be using the swap file\nUsually equal to the size of your general elasticache\n\n\nEvictions\nWhen an old piece of memory is swapped with a newer\n\n\nConcurrent connections\nFind out if you are not releasing connections properly (assumed same as RDS)\f\n\n\n\nAWS Organisations\n\nPurpose of AWS orgs\nAWS Organisations allow you to manage multiple AWS accounts\nYou can apply policies to your organisation that allow you to control access to AWS accounts\nYou can automate account access / creation\nCan group accounts (departments, business functions etc)\nUsed to consolidate billing across different accounts\nCan restrict what services people use\n\nTags & Resource Groups\n\nTags are key / value pairs (same as resources)\nResource groups are groups of tagged resources\nAWS systems manager\n\nAWS Config?\n\nIs a management tool that records configuration changes\nIs regional (needs to be turned on a per region basis)\nCan schedule a lambda to be triggered on config change\nPipes results into S3 for analysis later\nCan trigger periodically or on change\nYou can have up to 40 managed rules\nConfig needs read access to resources it‚Äôs tracking\nNeeds publish access to SNS to trigger notifications\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is AWS Config?\nRead: https://aws.amazon.com/config/faq/\nHow to setup a billing alarm?\nUnderstand resource groups better\nUnderstand AWS config

Which in turn gives double the space of a /1 netmask. This occurs because you're giving up one extra bit (which creates a X^2 increase in address range to your local network).\nYou could use different network masks, such as: /22\nClass A,B,C networks\n255.255.255.0 = /24\n\nclass C network (3rd 8bit block)\n24 bits for network\n8 bits for the host\nTotal space for host = [2^8 = 256 addresses]\n\n255.255.0.0 = /16\n\nclass B network (2nd 8 bit block)\n16 bits for network\n16 bits for the host\nTotal space for host = [2^16 = 65536 addresses]\n\n255.0.0.0 = /8\n\nclass A network (1st 8bit block)\n8 bits for network\n24 bits for the host\nTotal space for host = [2^24 = 16777216 addresses]\n\nDividing up subnets\nIf you wanted to work with logically divide a network you can use subnets. To have multiple subnets you can simply chop a subnet in half (and so on).\ne.g. if you're given 10.0.0.0 ‚Äî> 10.0.0.256 with a /24 subnet mask you could chop it up into:\n4 x /25 addresses\nSimply divide in two:\n\n10.0.0.0 ‚Äî> 10.0.0.127\n10.0.0.128 ‚Äî> 10.0.0.255\n\n2 x /26 addresses\nOr divide in four:\n\n10.0.0.0 ‚Äî> 10.0.0..63\n10.0.0.64 ‚Äî> 10.0.0.127\n10.0.0.128 ‚Äî> 10.0.0.192\n10.0.0.192 ‚Äî> 10.0.0.255\n\nYou can do this subnet splitting all the way down ( üê¢üê¢üê¢ )\nRoute Tables (Supernetting)\n\nA route table links networks to one another (next hop)\nYou can hardcode static IP's to the route table or you can use dynamic addressing (through various algorithms)\nIf address not found it goes to default route (0.0.0.0) and hops out of the network\nSupernetting allows multiple route table entries to be grouped together to avoid duplicated entries\n\nNetwork Address Translation\n\nA NAT maps publically available addresses to internal addresses\nAllows you to share a public IP amongst many internal IP's\nNAT Gateways are stateful so remember the outgoing requests and can map return traffic\nHome routers use NAT to link your network (local) to public\n\nVLAN\n\nLogically group together machines on a network so they can communicate across a network that has physical access to all other machines\nVLAN's are implemented in the packet routing devices (such as switches or trunks)\nVLANS ensure that only certain computers can talk to each other\n\nDNS Basics\n\nTLD's are governed by IANA\nNominet handles the UK domains\nDNS operates an inverted tree structure (root servers, ~300)\nRoot servers are accessed via Anycast\nAuthoritative servers have the current up to date information\nSome servers are purely cache, not authoritative\nTTL is a suggsetion, not a mandate\nA recursive query is one that is resolved by the server on the requestors behalf\n\nQuestions\n\nHow are netmasks passed as part of the IP protocol?\nWhat is the broadcast / network address?\nWhy are broadcast / network addresses the same IP's?\nWhy would you want more than 1 public IP if you can use NAT GW's?\nWhat are the \"two bits\" at the start of a network range (when subnetting)\nWhy are route tables needed?\nHow does supernetting really work?\nHow does NAT translation work (where is the tag stored in the frame/packet)?\nIs a trunk a physical device?
